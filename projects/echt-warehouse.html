  <h1>Improving WMS Layout</h1>
  <p>WMS Improvement / SQL Understanding</p>
</header>

<div class="project-container">

  <h2>Project Overview</h2>
  <p>
    This project involved improving an existing automated database and table system to enhance
    Warehouse Management System (WMS) workflows. The goal was to reduce operational complexity,
    minimize human error, and bridge the gap between experienced and new warehouse staff by
    consolidating multiple inventory tables into a single, intuitive view.
  </p>

  <h2>My Role & Contributions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Communicated system improvement ideas to a third-party WMS company.</li>
    <li>Tested newly implemented tables and reported bugs and edge cases.</li>
    <li>Collaborated with WMS developers on restructuring inventory tables and SQL-based changes.</li>
    <li>Trained staff on how to use the new table effectively, including workflow tips and best practices.</li>
    <li>Applying my SQL Knowledge and experience</li>

  </ul>

  <h2>Technologies & Skills Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>SQL (assisted and reviewed database adjustments)</li>
    <li>Data Analysis</li>
    <li>Process Improvement</li>
    <li>Technical Communication</li>
    <li>Problem Solving and Ideas</li>
    <li>Logistics & Warehouse Operations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Key Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Consolidated multiple inventory tables into a single unified view.</li>
    <li>Reduced onboarding time for new staff and minimized skill gaps.</li>
    <li>Lowered risk of missed customer items during daily operations.</li>
    <li>Prevented team collisions where multiple staff grabbed the same inventory.</li>
    <li>Improved confidence in inventory accuracy through instant refresh validation.</li>
    <li>Enabled data-driven decision-making for warehouse management.</li>
    <li>One computer can now handle the workload of two forklift operators, or a 
      forklift operator can complete the computer tasks themselves. </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Thinking, Problem-Solving Process & Story</h2>
    <p>
      
    The main challenge was managing three different tables simultaneously: 
    <ol>
      <li>checking if each pallet contained the required items, </li>
      <li>confirming whether items were collected, and </li>
      <li>tracking the location of every customer item for the day. </li>
    </ol>
    This multi-table system was prone to human error, and even a single mistake could cause major delays during busy days.
    </p>

    <p>
    While working in the warehouse, I identified the inefficiency and proposed a solution to my supervisor, who immediately connected me with the WMS company managing their system. 
    Together with a WMS developer, we designed a **single, consolidated table** capable of performing all three functions while simplifying the workflow and improving speed.
    </p>

    <p>
    My approach included:
    <ul>
      <li>Identifying all relevant variables and understanding their meaning and dependencies.</li>
      <li>Determining which data was essential and which could be excluded to reduce clutter.</li>
      <li>Combining related variables where possible to simplify analysis.</li>
      <li>Planning the solution under tight deadlines, communicating via phone calls, and sending PDFs when needed for clarity.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
    Initially, the new table improved speed significantly, allowing staff to instantly locate items and reducing the need for brute-force checks. However, a bug was detected: some items were missing because the table was **static**, updating only with warehouse input and not external orders. 
    By analyzing patterns in missing items, I identified the root cause related to order dates and worked with the developer to implement a fix. After this, the system ran accurately and efficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
    The final outcome:
    <ul>
      <li>Staff could process items faster and more accurately.</li>
      <li>Forklifts no longer outpaced the computer system; one computer can now handle tasks for two forklifts, or a forklift operator can perform the computer tasks themselves.</li>
      <li>The system reduced human error, improved operational efficiency, and simplified decision-making for management.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
